Reveal Template
</h1>

This is a template for making presentations with reveal.js. It supports displaying MathJax without an internet connection.
I use it to quickly get an offline presentation up and running.

## Preparation

To get started, execute following command in the project root:
```bash
npm install
```

That's it, all your dependencies should be installed by now. ðŸŽ‰

## Usage
Build your presentation inside [index.html](https://github.com/luca-schlecker/reveal-template/blob/main/index.html), just like you would usually.

As a little guide, take a look at the source code and presentation of the [demo.html](https://github.com/luca-schlecker/reveal-template/blob/main/demo.html) file. Many features are explained there.

To present, just open the `index.html` in your preferred browser. ðŸš€
